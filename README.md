# लिखो · Likho

**Indian script writing practice.**

Likho started as a project for people who grew up speaking an Indian language at home but never learned to write the script. You already know the sounds — Likho helps you connect them to the characters.

The core loop is simple: see a prompt, draw the character, reveal the answer, grade yourself honestly. Spaced repetition schedules your next review automatically and saves to your browser.

Free, open source, no account needed. Works in any browser.
